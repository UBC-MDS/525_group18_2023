## Project instruction
This project is based on [the rainforest dataset on figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681), which contains the output of different climate models as features. We aim to build and deploy an ensemble model on these outputs and compare the results with the actual rainfall in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia.
